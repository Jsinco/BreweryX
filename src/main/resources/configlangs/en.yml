    The used Ingredients and other brewing-data is saved to all Brewery Items. To prevent
    hacked clients from reading what exactly was used to brew an item, the data can be encoded/scrambled.
    This is a fast process to stop players from hacking out recipes, once they get hold of a brew.
    
    Only drawback: brew items can only be used on another server with the same encodeKey.
    When using Brews on multiple (BungeeCord) Servers, define a MYSQL database in the 'storage' settings.
